# PACELC Theorem

Let's learn about the PACELC theorem and its usage.

## Background
We cannot avoid partition in a distributed system, therefore, according to the CAP theorem, a distributed system should choose between consistency or availability. **ACID** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) databases, such as RDBMSs like MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server, chose consistency (refuse response if it cannot check with peers), while **BASE** (Basically Available, Soft-state, Eventually consistent) databases, such as NoSQL databases like MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis, chose availability (respond with local data without ensuring it is the latest with its peers).

**One place where the CAP theorem is silent is what happens when there is no network partition?** What choices does a distributed system have when there is no partition?

## Solution
The PACELC theorem states that in a system that replicates data:

- if there is a partition (‘P’), a distributed system can tradeoff between availability and consistency (i.e., ‘A’ and ‘C’);
- else (‘E’), when the system is running normally in the absence of partitions, the system can tradeoff between latency (‘L’) and consistency (‘C’).

The first part of the theorem (**PAC**) is the same as the CAP theorem, and the **ELC** is the extension. The whole thesis is assuming we maintain high availability by replication. So, when there is a failure, CAP theorem prevails. But if not, we still have to consider the tradeoff between consistency and latency of a replicated system.

## Examples
- **Dynamo and Cassandra** are **PA/EL** systems: They choose availability over consistency when a partition occurs; otherwise, they choose lower latency.
- **BigTable and HBase** are **PC/EC** systems: They will always choose consistency, giving up availability and lower latency.
- **MongoDB** can be considered **PA/EC** (default configuration): MongoDB works in a primary/secondaries configuration. In the default configuration, all writes and reads are performed on the primary. As all replication is done asynchronously (from primary to secondaries), when there is a network partition in which primary is lost or becomes isolated on the minority side, there is a chance of losing data that is unreplicated to secondaries, hence there is a loss of consistency during partitions. Therefore it can be concluded that **in the case of a network partition, MongoDB chooses availability, but otherwise guarantees consistency**. Alternately, when MongoDB is configured to write on majority replicas and read from the primary, it could be categorized as PC/EC.
